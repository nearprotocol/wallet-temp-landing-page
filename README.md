## Prerequisites

If you do not have the Gatsby CLI installed yet, do it first.

```bash
npm install --global gatsby-cli
```

The Gatsby CLI uses Node and npm which you will also need installed. More information can be found on [GatsbyJS.org](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-one/).

## Running

```bash
gatsby develop
```

The site will be opened up in your default browser on http://localhost:8000

Edit code in the `/src`, save changes, and they'll reload instantly in the browser.

## ðŸ’« Deploy

To create an optimized build of the site run this command

```bash
gatsby build
```

A `/public` folder will be created with the built files.
